# Microprocessor-and-Gait-Monitoring
Done using Assembly Language and Embedded C++. Project focuses on the Gait movement of the targeted person. Gait monitoring is done with the help of KL25Z board where the accelerometer
is interfaced with the help of I2C protocol. I2C has been configured in a register level manner to read data from the corresponding axes. The LED's has been configured to blink at 
different rate and colour depending on the position of the person. After processing the data an alert message is sent to the teminal using the Universal Asynchronous Receiver/ Transmiter
Protocol.
